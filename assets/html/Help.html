<p>Tap a tile in the world to interact with the object or move there if empty.</p>
<p>Pick up collectibles, but be careful with the amount of space you have in the inventory!
Collectibles are needed for some switches. If they don't turn on, you do not have
the correct Collectible in your inventory.</p>
<p>Use the reset level and restart game options in the menu if you are stuck,
but be careful, as you will lose all progress.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>
