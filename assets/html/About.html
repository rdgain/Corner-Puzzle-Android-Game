<h1> Backstory </h1>

<p>Xootopia is a fun and happy place to live. Although pretty similar to Earth, 
there is one clear difference: the air on the planet is toxic to its inhabitants. 
It doesn’t kill immediately, but it makes people go crazy and do weird things – 
like giving their kids odd names. So the scientists have devised complex systems 
to filter the air and turn into a harmless version. They called the poisonous pure 
form of the air Puffs. Everyone feared there could be leaks one day.</p>

<p>As it goes with every story, the people’s fears came true. It seemed like an 
ordinary day in Central Lands, the big machinery peacefully humming along. Then, 
out of nowhere, Bannon noticed them – the Puffs. They had hints of purple and red 
and wherever they touched the world, the colours changed. Somehow, the machinery 
had turned the Puffs into a new version that was toxic even to the environment!</p>

<p>This was an emergency. It did take a while to pin down where the head engineer, 
Loop, was at the moment. She wasn’t in Central Lands at work and Bannon discovered 
she was actually on leave, all the way in her home in Chipville. But he needed her 
to travel as soon as possible. He sent an urgent notification through a Flyer – a 
funny little device that zoomed through the air so fast the naked eye could barely 
catch it.</p>

<p>When she received the notification, Loop was alarmed immediately. She had worked 
on the Central Systems herself – a failure was definitely her fault and she could 
not have the world she loved die because of her mistake. So there was no hesitation 
in her decision. She used the Flyer to send Bannon back a reply, announcing that 
she would start her journey straight away.</p>

<p>It wasn’t as easy as that, though. Chipville was terribly far away from the 
Central Lands, on the edge of the world. She would have a long distance to travel 
and who knows how the new Puffs affected the world. She left the house expecting 
the worst and met her first challenge: rocks had appeared everywhere, out of nowhere, 
blocking her path. She was not strong enough to move them, so she would have to use 
her wits to find a way across.</p>

<p>But the world depended on her success so she did not fear what lay before her.</p>
